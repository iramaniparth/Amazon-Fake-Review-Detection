__DESCRIPTION:

The aim of our project is to detect fake reviews on Amazon using the review text. Our approach combines semi-supervised learning and transformer models to identify fake Amazon reviews.
The Datasets used in our projects are:
Labelled Dataset from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/lievgarcia/amazon-reviews
Unlabelled dataset from Amazon - https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_multilingual_US_v1_00.tsv.gz

Following are the steps involved in creating and evaluation of the Model to predict fake reviews using review text:
(1) We split the original labeled dataset into four parts: 70% training set, 10% first validation set to compare initial supervised classification models, 10% second validation set to compare the updated classification models, and 10% test set to evaluate the final classifierâ€™s performance. 
(2) We trained the initial model on the training set of labeled data. 
(3) We generated pseudo-labels by using the initial model to classify the unlabeled data set. 
(4) The most confidently predicted pseudo-labels above a specific threshold became training data for the next step. 
(5) We updated the initial model using the pseudo-labels as training data. 
(6) Finally, we tested the final classifier on the test set of the original labeled data. 

Modules used:
Pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn - Commonly used Machine Learning python libraries
transformers - Transformers provides thousands of pretrained models to perform tasks on texts such as classification, information extraction, question answering, summarization, translation, text generation and more in over 100 languages.
datasets - Huggingface Datasets is a library for easily accessing and sharing datasets, and evaluation metrics for Natural Language Processing (NLP), computer vision, and audio tasks.

The following are the steps and respective code (.py files) invloved in obtaining the final model file that is used for prediction.
